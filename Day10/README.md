## Day 10 Shell Scripting Tutorials

## What is shell Script
  - A shell scipt is a list of commands in a computer that is computer program that is run by the Unix shell which is a command-line interpreter. A Shell script usally has comments that describe the steps.
  - Allow you to run if-else statement and loops.
  - A file that contains a series of commands.
  - A plain text file.
  - It executes the command on each line, one line at a time.
  - The terminal usually allows just one command at a time.
  - Shell script allows you to combine and run multiple commands together

## When do we need a shell script?
  - You need to enter multiple shell commands and you will need to do it again in the future.
  - ShellScript eliminates repetitive tasks through automation.
  - Using a good script can reduce the change of error.
  - A shell script can perform a task faster than a human can.
  - You have to do a task more than once, but it something that you rarely do.

## Why use shell
  - Speed of deployment
  - No worrying about low-level programming objects.
  - Ease and speed of learning.
  - Performance and efficiency.
  - Anything you can do on the command line can be automated by writing a shell script.
  - allow you to hand off work to others.
  - Act as a form of documentation.
  - Fairly quick and easy to write.

## First Shell Script

  - Let's create the 1st script with first.sh. 
  - Change the file permission using the below command.
  - let's run the script using the below command and see the output.

## Shell Script Shebang use
  - The #! syntax is used in scripts to indicate an interpreter for execution under UNIX / Linux operating systems. The directive must be the first line in te Linux Shell 
     script and must with shebang #!

  - The sharp sign (#) and the bang sign (!) that why called the shebang.
  - For example: /bin/bash
  - #!/bin/bash
  - How to check the shells in our linux
  - cat /etc/shells
## let's run a script with other interpreter. create a file using the below snippts
  - #!/usr/bin/python
  - print("Hello this is python script")
## now let's change the mode and give the execute permission to file and execute it.
  - chmod +x second.sh
  - ./second.sh

  - Student work:
  - Write an Article & post it on LinkedIn Shell Scripting.
